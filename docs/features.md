# Features

OkiDoki is an **open source** documentation generator designed for developers who want powerful documentation without complexity. Built by the community for the community, it's free forever with no vendor lock-in. Here are the top 6 features that make it essential:

## 1. 📝 Markdown First

Write in standard markdown - no proprietary formats or vendor lock-in:

```markdown
# Your Documentation
Just write **normal markdown** with `code blocks`, tables, and links.

- No learning curve
- Use any markdown editor
- Version control friendly
```

**Benefits:** Focus on content, not syntax. Your documentation remains portable and future-proof.

## 2. 🔧 Dynamic Variables

Inject dynamic content with global and local variables:

### Global Variables (`okidoki.yaml`)
```yaml
globals:
  version: "2.1.0"
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
  company: "Acme Corp"
```

### Local Variables (Frontmatter)
```markdown
---
title: "API Guide"
author: "John Doe"
updated: "2024-01-15"
---

# {{title}} v{{globals.version}}
Built by {{author}} for {{globals.company}}
Updated: {{updated}}
```

**Benefits:** Keep documentation up-to-date automatically. Change once, update everywhere.

## 3. 🎨 Tabs, Badges and Admonitions

Rich interactive components without HTML:

### Tabs

## 6. 🔍 SEO Optimization

Built-in SEO features for better discoverability:

- **Automatic sitemap.xml** - Generated with every build for search engine indexing
- **Meta descriptions** - Configure in `okidoki.yaml` for better search results  
- **Semantic HTML** - Clean, accessible markup for search engines
- **Fast loading** - Optimized performance improves search rankings
- **Subdirectory support** - Configure `baseUrl` for hosting under subdirectories (required for GitHub Pages)

```yaml
site:
  title: "My Documentation"
  description: "Complete API documentation and guides"  # Used in meta tags
  baseUrl: "/my-repo/"  # Required for GitHub Pages: username.github.io/my-repo/
```

**GitHub Pages Example:** With `baseUrl: "/my-repo/"`, your site works correctly at `username.github.io/my-repo/`.
