# Features

OkiDoki is an **open source** documentation generator designed for developers who want powerful documentation without complexity. Built by the community for the community, it's free forever with no vendor lock-in. Here are the top 5 features that make it essential:

## 1. üìù Markdown First

Write in standard markdown - no proprietary formats or vendor lock-in:

```markdown
# Your Documentation
Just write **normal markdown** with `code blocks`, tables, and links.

- No learning curve
- Use any markdown editor
- Version control friendly
```

**Benefits:** Focus on content, not syntax. Your documentation remains portable and future-proof.

## 2. üîß Dynamic Variables

Inject dynamic content with global and local variables:

### Global Variables (`okidoki.yaml`)
```yaml
globals:
  version: "2.1.0"
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
  company: "Acme Corp"
```

### Local Variables (Frontmatter)
```markdown
---
title: "API Guide"
author: "John Doe"
updated: "2024-01-15"
---

# {{title}} v{{globals.version}}
Built by {{author}} for {{globals.company}}
Updated: {{updated}}
```

**Benefits:** Keep documentation up-to-date automatically. Change once, update everywhere.
