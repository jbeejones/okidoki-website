# Features

OkiDoki is an **open source** documentation generator designed for developers who want powerful documentation without complexity. Built by the community for the community, it's free forever with no vendor lock-in. Here are the top 6 features that make it essential:

## 1. Markdown First

Write in standard markdown - no proprietary formats or vendor lock-in:

```markdown
# Your Documentation
Just write **normal markdown** with `code blocks`, tables, and links.

- No learning curve
- Use any markdown editor
- Version control friendly
```

**Benefits:** Focus on content, not syntax. Your documentation remains portable and future-proof.

## 2. Dynamic Variables

Inject dynamic content with global and local variables:

### Global Variables (`okidoki.yaml`)
```yaml
site:
  title: MyDocs
globals:
  version: "2.1.0"
  api_url: "https://api.example.com"
  company: "Acme Corp"
```

### Local Variables
```markdown
---
title: "API Guide"
author: "John Doe"
updated: "2024-01-15"
---

# {{title}} v{{globals.version}}
Built by {{author}} for {{globals.company}}
Updated: {{updated}}
```

**Benefits:** Keep documentation up-to-date automatically. Change once, update everywhere.

## 3. Tabs, Badges and Admonitions

Rich interactive components enhance your documentation with tabs, badges, and alerts - all using simple markdown-like syntax:

### Tabs

<div>
<pre>
&#58;&#58;&#58;tabs
&#58;&#58;&#58;tab JavaScript
```js
const api = new ApiClient('{{api_url}}');
console.log('Ready ...')
```
&#58;&#58;&#58;
&#58;&#58;&#58;tab Python
```python
api = ApiClient('{{api_url}}')
print('Ready ...')
```
&#58;&#58;&#58;
&#58;&#58;&#58;
</pre>
</div>

:::

:::danger

:::

:::success
Positive confirmation or success message.
:::

:::neutral

```

##### 2. Handlebars Alert Helper
```markdown
{{#alert}}
I am neutral with the Handlebars alert helper
{{/alert}}

{{#alert "info"}}
Information alert using Handlebars syntax
{{/alert}}

{{#alert "warning"}}
Warning alert with Handlebars helper
{{/alert}}
```

##### Available States
- **tip** - Light blue, for helpful advice
- **info** - Blue, for general information  
- **warning** - Orange/yellow, for important warnings
- **danger** - Red, for critical alerts
- **success** - Green, for positive messages
- **neutral** - Gray, for neutral information

:::tip

:::

:::neutral
